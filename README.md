### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at Microsoft as a cloud developer advocate. In my role, I spend almost all my time contributing to open source projects related to [Go](https://go.dev), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), and [Cloud Native](https://cncf.io) technologies.

I'm currently working primarily on [KEDA-HTTP](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on). I also contribute to [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda) and the [Cluster API Provider for Azure](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure). Outside of those projects, I created and maintain [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens) as time permits, and I'm an emeritus core maintainer of the [Kubernetes service catalog project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog). 

You can reach me on the internet at `arschles` on most platforms including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arschles), [Gophers slack](https://gophers.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-o2s1e0w3-uQ1wyrfVloMffstqOgKIZQ#/) and [Kubernetes slack](http://slack.kubernetes.io/).

If you want to read more about me, check out my blog and personal site at [arschles.com](https://arschles.com). I also write occassionally on [dev.to](https://dev.to/arschles).

See you soon!
