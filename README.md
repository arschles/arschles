I work at Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineer working on Web Assembly and related technologies. I generally love working on systems problems, from virtualization to distributed systems.

In the recent past, I've worked on the following projects:

- [KEDA-HTTP](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on) - an addition to [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda) that enables operators to scale their HTTP-based workloads up and down.
- [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda) - the **K**ubernetes **E**vent **D**riven **A**utoscaler. This is a CNCF incubating project which lets you automatically scale your Kubernetes workloads up or down (including to/from zero replicas) based on one of [many](https://keda.sh/docs/2.4/scalers/) different external systems including Kafka, Redis, ActiveMQ, AWS SQS, Prometheus, and more. The KEDA-HTTP project is built atop this one.
- [Cluster API Provider for Azure](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure) - This is the in-cluster Kubernetes operator that configures your Kubernetes cluster to run on Azure. It runs on every [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) cluster.
- [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens) - This is a self-hosted server that can host Go module dependencies on your own infrastructure, rather than using ther public proxy at [proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org). Athens is used by many companies and individuals who want to control and secure their dependencies.

I'm also an emeritus core maintainer of the [Kubernetes service catalog project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog).
