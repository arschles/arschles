### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at Microsoft as a cloud developer advocate. In my role, I spend almost all my time contributing to open source projects related to [Go](https://go.dev), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), and [Cloud Native](https://cncf.io) technologies.

I'm currently working on [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens) and [KEDA-HTTP](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on). If you ever want to contribute to either projects, please let me know! We're always looking for new community members who want to get involved.

You can reach me on the internet at `arschles` on most platforms including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arschles), [Gophers slack](https://gophers.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-o2s1e0w3-uQ1wyrfVloMffstqOgKIZQ#/) and [Kubernetes slack](http://slack.kubernetes.io/).

If you want to read more about me, check out my blog and personal site at [arschles.com](https://arschles.com). I also write occassionally on [dev.to](https://dev.to/arschles).

See you soon!
